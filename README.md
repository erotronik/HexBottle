## Features

* Borosilicate glass bottle, easy to clean, harder to break
* Air input is through vents not a pipe, for aesthetics and safety
* Low cost compared to commercial bottles
* Uses easily sourced parts including bottle and 3D printed parts you can make yourself or use an online service

## Background

[@toydolly](https://github.com/toydolly) presents an easy to make bubble bottle that you just can't buy in shops. Make your own or recruit one of your fellow HexDrones to help.

We really don't want to make and sell them. So why not build your own? Please do tag and show us if you build one. If you make any improvements we'd love to see them too, drop an issue or PR here.

## Safety

This bubbler bottle is designed for your own personal use in a situation where you have the ability to disconnect your mask. It is not designed to restrict or block any ability to breathe. If you plan to use them at an event please check with an event organiser first.

## Build your own

# Printing and assembling the bottle
## Parts list:
* The STL files for the cap and spigot
* A [RYACO 800ml wide mouth bottle](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B088B7RL98/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_RTAABATTSC8DW0E9HZ2Y)
* The seal from the lid of the RYACO bottle
* A short length of 6mm tubing
* Some superglue or similar adhesive

## Construction
### Step 1
* Slice the STL files to suit your 3D printer
* We sliced in Cura at a 0.2mm layer height with supports and 20% infill
### Step 2
* Print your parts 
* We printed in both PLA and PETG. PLA is a little better
### Step 3
* Remove support materials. Make sure you really get in at the channel for the seal
* Check that the cap fits the bottle properly before proceeding
### Step 4
* On the underside of the cap, superglue the spigot into the hole and leave to set
### Step 5
* Sand, paint or finish to your own taste
* You can remove the RYACO logo on the bottle with a sharp blade by carefully scraping the letters off.
### Step 6
* Remove the seal from the RYACO bottle lid and insert it into the channel on the cap's underside
### Step 7
* Add some water, connect a hose and BUBBLES shall be yours
